				The Employee Interaction Center
(EIC) helps streamline the delivery of HR processes and services
through a centralized delivery channel, based on a shared services
model. The EIC is especially useful for companies with a
geographically-distributed workforce, virtual teams, or retirees
with limited portal access.
				Employees can contact the EIC at
anytime from anywhere to find answers to their most frequently
asked questions, update their HR data, or obtain additional support
for more complex HR inquiries.CallCenterAgents, working for the EIC,
accept and respond to incoming inquiries through multiple
communication channels, expanding the reach, flexibility and
convenience of service offerings to all employees.
				This business process applies when
an employee needs HR assistance recording or updating employee
data. This data may not be accessible through self-services or the
employee may require additional guidance and support, beyond
self-services, to complete the data change request. The EIC offers
an alternative delivery channel to supplement self-service options
and provide an additional layer of HR support.</description>

					Addresses the need for
an enterprise to perform reliable risk management - a requirement
that is becoming increasingly important. Organizations must
constantly keep up with new commercial and corporate legal
regulations, as well as inherent market and operational risks. Not
only fiscal and supervisory authorities, but also participants in
international capital markets expect organizations to have
synchronized processes and a consolidated view of planning,
strategy development, finances, controlling, and risk management.
As a result, it is becoming more and more important to integrate
risk management and value-based management, as well as integrating
previously separated planning and reporting processes. Risk
management in SAP Strategic Enterprise Management (SAP SEM) enables
a company to identify, quantify, monitor, and control risks and
their potential impact on its goals. SAP SEM supports the entire
risk management process in the enterprise. An early warning system
and a control instrument, SAP SEM permits the addressing of current
legal requirements for control and provides access to corporate
risk information.</description>

focuses in the value drivers that a company identifies as valid to
manage success and which thus are most important. mySAP ERP
provides web based value driver trees that allow to visualize the
mathematical and logical relations between value drivers as well as
the simulation of the effect of changes in the value drivers data.
As a result, strategic targets can be fixed and used to form a
framework for the subsequent operational planning.</description>

prices, and quantities can be taken from purchase orders and goods
receipts. Vendor Evaluation also uses data from the Quality
Management component, such as the results of incoming inspections
or quality audits. The Vendor Evaluation component helps you select
sources of supply and facilitates the continual monitoring of
existing supply relationships. The standard system offers you a
scoring range from 1 to 100 points, which is used to measure the
performance of your vendors on the basis of five main criteria:You can also define other or further main criteria, as required.

			You can use this business process to evaluate vendors. The
Vendor Evaluation component supports you in optimizing your
procurement processes for both materials and services. Vendor
evaluation is completely integrated into the Materials Management
component. This means that information such as delivery dates,
prices, and quantities can be taken from purchase orders and goods
receipts. Vendor Evaluation also uses data from the Quality
Management component, such as the results of incoming inspections
or quality audits. The Vendor Evaluation component helps you select
sources of supply and facilitates the continual monitoring of
existing supply relationships. The standard system offers you a
scoring range from 1 to 100 points, which is used to measure the
performance of your vendors on the basis of five main criteria:You can also define other or further main criteria, as required.
You can assign different weights to the individual criteria.</description>

judging the performance of business processes internally by time
period, collaboratively with others within your distribution supply
chain, and externally by benchmarking against similar

management: On a strategic level, distribution statistics give you
the feedback needed for true closed-loop supply chain management,
which is key to driving continuous improvement, delivering superior
performance over time, and ensuring that your supply chain
continues to be efficient and competitive. Operative performance
management: On a day-to-day operational level, the solution
provides constant surveillance of key performance measurements and
automatically generates an alert when there is a deviation from
plan, so that you can keep processes working at maximum
efficiency.</description>

			You can use this business process to know the process flow in which you bill a customer for resources used such as personnel costs or materials. You use billing to create invoices for your customers.Before a billing request is created you see a modifiable overview screen that enables you to determine what the billing request must look like, and what amounts should be calculated, postponed, or canceled. During billing, the system generates dynamic items from the information about expenses involved. You must simulate the prices and save the dynamic items. You can then generate the billing request.</description>

			You can use this business process to analyze data and processes
from the area of human capital management (HCM).  By doing so, you
can provide the basis for decision-making processes at management
level and also perform benchmarking between the different
organizational units. 
     With SAP Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW), you can
integrate, consolidate, and clean up data from SAP and non SAP
sources.  This data may be current or historical data.  SAP BW not
only provides data in a passive form, it also enables you to
distribute information actively, for example, by e-mail.

			You can use this business process to monitor the risk of losses on receivables from your customers and to restrict this loss by means of a credit limit. Accounts Receivable Accounting (FI-AR) regularly provides SAP Credit Management (FIN-FSCM-CR) with the current status of customer open items. When you receive and process new sales orders in the sales and distribution system (SD), you can call up the credit check in SAP Credit Management. The system checks whether the order is within the credit limit for the customer and also checks characteristics of the customer’s score. This enables you to recognize very early when a customer is no longer able to pay open invoices due to his weak financial situation. You can then hold back further deliveries to customers via SD so that the customer is forced to pay before he receives any further deliveries.</description>

              <description>
			You can use this business process to monitor the risk of losses on receivables from your customers and to restrict this loss by means of a credit limit. Accounts Receivable Accounting (FI-AR) regularly provides SAP Credit Management (FIN-FSCM-CR) with the current status of customer open items. When you receive and process new sales orders in the sales and distribution system (SD), you can call up the credit check in SAP Credit Management. The system checks whether the order is within the credit limit for the customer and also checks characteristics of the customer’s score. This enables you to recognize very early when a customer is no longer able to pay open invoices due to his weak financial situation. You can then hold back further deliveries to customers via SD so that the customer is forced to pay before he receives any further deliveries.</description>

              <description>
			This business process enables an Interaction Center agent to enter a dispute case when a customer announces an incorrect invoice, a missing payment, an incorrect or missing credit request. The process also provides a list of existing disputes for the account or business agreement confirmed on the agent, which e.g. can be used to manage disputes on second level processing. During the creation and processing of Disputes, related objects (e.g. disputed objects, further information, correspondence to the customer) can be linked to the dispute, actions and activities (follow-ups) could be triggered and the dispute itself can be forwarded to post processors determined by a partner determination. In this business process it is also possible to grant a credit to a customer e.g. as a part of the managing disputes process but also without referring to a dispute. The credit may be subject to approval before it can be processed through billing and transferred into a posting document. Additionally in exceptional cases it may be required to capture data that will lead to a debit and not to a credit. Then the possibility for the creation of an adjustment request will be provided in this business process.</description>

				Financial accounting
supports the valuation and reporting of inventory according to
different regulations. Uses the Material Ledger component to carry
inventory values in two additional currencies/valuations. Performs
all goods movements in the Material Ledger in up to three
currencies or valuations. Translates currency amounts into foreign
currencies at historical exchange rates at the time of posting.
Supports the determination of actual costs (compared to standard
costs) for externally procured materials and materials produced
in-house via Actual Costing. Uses this to valuate material
inventories, such as raw materials as well as semi-finished and
finished products, accordingly.

With this procedure, you decide on the date when the payment is made, thereby actively influencing the payment processing in your company. Note that, when collecting receivables from credit card accounts, payment may be unsuccessful if the customer provided an incorrect or non-existent credit card number or if the customer's credit card company refuses payment due to insufficient funds in the account. Therefore, you can only implement collection of payments from credit card accounts provided you use returns processing.</description>

			You can use this business process to automatically process data from the electronic account statement that you receive from your bank. Applying the rules defined in Customizing, the system interprets the customer data, automatically assigns payments and returns to the contract accounts, and clears the corresponding open items. If the specified rules are insufficient for automatic processing, the system produces a clarification worklist. This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

In this way, any receivables due are cleared directly in the contract account. With the direct debit procedure, you specify when the incoming payment occurs and thereby reduce capital and process costs. It is important to note that customers retain the right to revoke the debit memo. Therefore, you can only implement the direct debit procedure in combination with returns processing.</description>

Applying the rules defined in Customizing, the system interprets the customer data, automatically assigns payments and returns to the contract accounts, and clears the corresponding open items. If the specified rules are insufficient for automatic processing, the system produces a clarification worklist. This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

			In this business process, the Interaction Center agent can come to an installment payment agreement with a business partner who does not fulfill their payment obligations and create an installment plan to the amount of the original receivables.

With this procedure, you decide on the date when the payment is made, thereby actively influencing the payment processing in your company. Note that, when collecting receivables from credit card accounts, payment may be unsuccessful if the customer provided an incorrect or non-existent credit card number or if the customer's credit card company refuses payment due to insufficient funds in the account. Therefore, you can only implement collection of payments from credit card accounts provided you use returns processing.</description>

			You can use this business process to automatically process data from the electronic account statement that you receive from your bank. Applying the rules defined in Customizing, the system interprets the customer data, automatically assigns payments and returns to the contract accounts, and clears the corresponding open items. If the specified rules are insufficient for automatic processing, the system produces a clarification worklist. This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

			In this business process, you collect open invoices or other receivables directly by direct debit from your customers' bank accounts. In this way, any receivables due are cleared directly in the contract account. With the direct debit procedure, you specify when the incoming payment occurs and thereby reduce capital and process costs. It is important to note that customers retain the right to revoke the debit memo. Therefore, you can only implement the direct debit procedure in combination with returns processing.</description>

			You can use this business process to automatically process data from the electronic account statement that you receive from your bank. Applying the rules defined in Customizing, the system interprets the customer data, automatically assigns payments and returns to the contract accounts, and clears the corresponding open items. If the specified rules are insufficient for automatic processing, the system produces a clarification worklist. This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

You transfer data into General Ledger Accounting and Profitability Analysis separately. After the transfer, you can trace back the postingsusing the reconciliation key in the general ledger document. To make sure that the transfer into General Ledger Accounting or Profitability Analysis was successful, you carry out reconciliation. To ensure a fast and relevant clarification, this reconciliation should take place daily like the transfer.</description>

This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

			In this business process, you collect open invoices or other receivables directly from a customer's credit card. In this way, any receivables due are cleared directly in the contract account. With this procedure, you decide on the date when the payment is made, thereby actively influencing the payment processing in your company. Note that, when collecting receivables from credit card accounts, payment may be unsuccessful if the customer provided an incorrect or non-existent credit card number or if the customer's credit card company refuses payment due to insufficient funds in the account. Therefore, you can only implement collection of payments from credit card accounts provided you use returns processing.</description>

Agents can display the call list size, the period, or the duration of the call list, the number of customers, and the names of the customers who are to be called. They can also review the information to be obtained from the customer if the call list is assigned a script. The agents can gather information before they begin answering calls or calling customers themselves. Resulting from the conversation with the customer, you can then take payments from the customer for the due items for dunning and create deferral for open items.</description>

			In this business
process, you process payment orders relating to the debit memo
procedure and transfers. A payment order is created when the
payment has been made but the clearing posting should only occur in
the system when the payment appears on the account statement of
your house bank. With the creation of payment orders, any items
open on the key date are displayed. If the execution date for a
payment order is in the future, the open item is only cleared when
payment has taken place.</description>

			In this business process, you generate call lists from the dunning proposal and dunning activity run, which are then available for use in the Interaction Center (IC) to dun customers by telephone and request payment for open items. Agents can display the call list size, the period, or the duration of the call list, the number of customers, and the names of the customers who are to be called. They can also review the information to be obtained from the customer if the call list is assigned a script. The agents can gather information before they begin answering calls or calling customers themselves. Resulting from the conversation with the customer, you can then take payments from the customer for the due items for dunning and create deferral for open items.</description>

			You can use this business process to automatically process data from the electronic account statement that you receive from your bank. Applying the rules defined in Customizing, the system interprets the customer data, automatically assigns payments and returns to the contract accounts, and clears the corresponding open items. If the specified rules are insufficient for automatic processing, the system produces a clarification worklist. This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

			In this business process, you generate call lists from the dunning proposal and dunning activity run, which are then available for use in the Interaction Center (IC) to dun customers by telephone and request payment for open items. Agents can display the call list size, the period, or the duration of the call list, the number of customers, and the names of the customers who are to be called. They can also review the information to be obtained from the customer if the call list is assigned a script. The agents can gather information before they begin answering calls or calling customers themselves. Resulting from the conversation with the customer, you can then take payments from the customer for the due items for dunning and create deferral for open items.</description>

In this way, any receivables due are cleared directly in the contract account. With the direct debit procedure, you specify when the incoming payment occurs and thereby reduce capital and process costs. It is important to note that customers retain the right to revoke the debit memo. Therefore, you can only implement the direct debit procedure in combination with returns processing.</description>

			You can use this business process to automatically process data from the electronic account statement that you receive from your bank. Applying the rules defined in Customizing, the system interprets the customer data, automatically assigns payments and returns to the contract accounts, and clears the corresponding open items. If the specified rules are insufficient for automatic processing, the system produces a clarification worklist. This means that you can close processing of the account statement correctly from the accounting view without posting to the contract accounts. You process the clarification worklist manually. The system then automatically posts any clarified cases.</description>

        <description>
					Records costs incurred
during the company operations by assigning them to cost centers
(assigned to managers or organizational units). Plans, records, and
then analyzes costs against the plan. Uses internal orders to plan,
collect, and settle the costs of internal jobs and tasks. Monitors
internal orders throughout their entire lifecycle using the SAP
system, from initial creation, through the planning and posting of
all the actual costs, to the final settlement and archiving. The budget monitoring
process can optionally be executed using SAP Manager Self Service
or otherwise Duet. Duet budget monitoring provides a wealth of
tools and information for tracking, analyzing, and acting on
individual and group budgeting data all from within Microsoft
Office. Users can receive reports from mySAP ERP in their Outlook
Inbox, enabling better budget monitoring through proactive alerts
to time-critical information. Duet enables users to schedule
regular reports or submit ad hoc report requests. All reports are
available for offline use, yet users can still drill into the
analytic and source data as well as distribute reports to other
individuals. Budget owners can use Duet to set and receive alerts
and notifications in their Outlook Inbox – for example a
notification that a budget limited as been exceeded. Once the alert
has been received, the user can then request a budget transfer or a
posting adjustment. </description>

					Manages transfer prices,
which support organizations that divide tasks among different
organizational units by valuating the goods and services exchanged
between these units. Aids particularly large corporations that are
often divided into a number of independently operating divisions or
companies that exchange large quantities of goods and services with
one another. Lets transfer prices be used for controlling corporate
units as the division of labor between internationally operating
units increases, value-added chains become more complex and
responsibilities become more decentralized. Valuates the exchange
of goods and services using transfer prices, to significantly
influence the actual success of corporate divisions or profit
centers. Helps today's accounting systems provide decision support
that represents operational results from different points of views
and using different currencies.</description>

				Corporate governance is
the system of rules and regulations under which a corporation is
directed and controlled. It should ensure trustworthy and legally
compliant behavior of all employees and other parties involved (for
example, members of the advisory board). SAP software can help to
ensure, but not guarantee, that the objectives are being followed
and met.

					Addresses the need for
an enterprise to perform reliable risk management - a requirement
that is becoming increasingly important. Organizations must
constantly keep up with new commercial and corporate legal
regulations, as well as inherent market and operational risks. Not
only fiscal and supervisory authorities, but also participants in
international capital markets expect organizations to have
synchronized processes and a consolidated view of planning,
strategy development, finances, controlling, and risk management.
As a result, it is becoming more and more important to integrate
risk management and value-based management, as well as integrating
previously separated planning and reporting processes. Risk
management in SAP Strategic Enterprise Management (SAP SEM) enables
a company to identify, quantify, monitor, and control risks and
their potential impact on its goals. SAP SEM supports the entire
risk management process in the enterprise. An early warning system
and a control instrument, SAP SEM permits the addressing of current
legal requirements for control and provides access to corporate
risk information.</description>

				Talent management
consolidates all the strategic employee development processes
spanning the employees' career with the company:  from hire to
retire, including recruitment, education, career development, and
performance management.  It also encompasses the company view of
employee development, identifying and tracking high potential
employees to ensure future leaders can be effectively promoted from
within and that successors are identified for key positions.  A
strong Talent Management strategy enables the organization to find
the best people, leverage their talent in the right place and right
time, align employees and teams to corporate goals, maximize the
impact of training, and retain and promote top performers.

              <description>In consignment processing, the vendor provides materials and stores
them on your premises. The vendor remains the legal owner of the
material until you withdraw materials from the consignment stores.
Only then does the vendor require payment. The invoice is due at
set periods of time, for example, monthly. In addition, you can
also arrange with the vendor that you take over ownership of the
remaining consignment material after a certain period of time. The
consignment stock is managed under the same number as your own
stock. Consignment stock can, therefore, be transferred to the
available stock. You can define consignment prices in foreign
currency. The currency in which the order is placed with the vendor
applies for consignment withdrawals. • You can determine
period-specific consignment prices. • You can specify the
consignment price in any unit of measure. • You can make use of
other condition functions used in Purchasing, such as discounts and
price quantity scales. • Consignment stocks of the same material
from different vendors can be managed independently from one
another and at the price of the individual vendors. • Consignment
stocks are not valuated. When the material is withdrawn it is
valuated at the price of the respective vendor. • A consignment
material can be allocated to one of three stock types: o
Unrestricted-use stock o Quality inspection stock o Blocked stock
You can make transfer postings between these three stock types.
Withdrawals can only be posted from unrestricted stock, however.</description>

					Trading Contract is the main document in Trading Contract
Management. You can process both purchase and sales data either
simultaneously or separately, using one document. This forms the
basis of all purchasing, sales and expense processes and provides
you with a clear overview and process control of all related
business transactions. As it takes account of purchasing prices, sales prices and
expenses the trading contract allows you to perform a profitability
simulation immediately. The trading contract can support both back-to-back transactions
as well as one-sided purchasing and sales transactions. The Trading Contract can be used to generate standard documents,
such as purchase orders and sales orders and to control the entire
logistics chain for follow-on documents such as delivery and
billing documents.</description>

              <description>In consignment processing, the vendor provides materials and stores
them on your premises. The vendor remains the legal owner of the
material until you withdraw materials from the consignment stores.
Only then does the vendor require payment. The invoice is due at
set periods of time, for example, monthly. In addition, you can
also arrange with the vendor that you take over ownership of the
remaining consignment material after a certain period of time. The
consignment stock is managed under the same number as your own
stock. Consignment stock can, therefore, be transferred to the
available stock. You can define consignment prices in foreign
currency. The currency in which the order is placed with the vendor
applies for consignment withdrawals. • You can determine
period-specific consignment prices. • You can specify the
consignment price in any unit of measure. • You can make use of
other condition functions used in Purchasing, such as discounts and
price quantity scales. • Consignment stocks of the same material
from different vendors can be managed independently from one
another and at the price of the individual vendors. • Consignment
stocks are not valuated. When the material is withdrawn it is
valuated at the price of the respective vendor. • A consignment
material can be allocated to one of three stock types: o
Unrestricted-use stock o Quality inspection stock o Blocked stock
You can make transfer postings between these three stock types.
Withdrawals can only be posted from unrestricted stock, however.</description>

listed in the purchase order and provided to the subcontractor. The
components can be determined by the system via a bill of material.
The components can be provided from a third-party-supplier instead
of from our own plant. The quantities of the components to be
provided to the vendor are entered into the stock of material to be
provided to vendor. This stock has the following features: • It is
managed as part of your total valuated stock, and is available for
MRP. • It is only managed at plant level, since it is not stored at
your own company but on the vendor's site. • Two stock types are
possible: • unrestricted-use stock • quality inspection stock Stock
can be transferred between the two stock types. Withdrawals can
only be posted from unrestricted stock, however. • You can take a
physical inventory of the stock of material to be provided to

			A purchase requisition
describes a demand that is released to the purchasing department.
The demand can be created automatically, e.g. as result of a MRP
run or by assigning components or services to a maintenance or
production order. Alternatively, the purchase requisition can be
entered manually or transferred from another system.  The
accounting data can already be assigned and checked during
processing of the purchase requisition. Sourcing (incl. initiating
a RFQ process) can be executed based on a purchase requisition as
well as assignment of documents.</description>

you have received such a request. When entering a response it is
possible e.g. to name the service agent or reject individual items
in the request. If pricing has not occurred in the request, you
must enter a price in the bid.After the vendor has sent back the bid, you as an employee or
purchasing assistant will be notified by e-mail of receipt of the
vendor's response.</description>

              <description>In consignment processing, the vendor provides materials and stores
them on your premises. The vendor remains the legal owner of the
material until you withdraw materials from the consignment stores.
Only then does the vendor require payment. The invoice is due at
set periods of time, for example, monthly. In addition, you can
also arrange with the vendor that you take over ownership of the
remaining consignment material after a certain period of time. The
consignment stock is managed under the same number as your own
stock. Consignment stock can, therefore, be transferred to the
available stock. You can define consignment prices in foreign
currency. The currency in which the order is placed with the vendor
applies for consignment withdrawals. • You can determine
period-specific consignment prices. • You can specify the
consignment price in any unit of measure. • You can make use of
other condition functions used in Purchasing, such as discounts and
price quantity scales. • Consignment stocks of the same material
from different vendors can be managed independently from one
another and at the price of the individual vendors. • Consignment
stocks are not valuated. When the material is withdrawn it is
valuated at the price of the respective vendor. • A consignment
material can be allocated to one of three stock types: o
Unrestricted-use stock o Quality inspection stock o Blocked stock
You can make transfer postings between these three stock types.
Withdrawals can only be posted from unrestricted stock, however.</description>

The components can be provided from a third-party-supplier instead
of from our own plant. The quantities of the components to be
provided to the vendor are entered into the stock of material to be
provided to vendor. This stock has the following features: • It is
managed as part of your total valuated stock, and is available for
MRP. • It is only managed at plant level, since it is not stored at
your own company but on the vendor's site. • Two stock types are
possible: • unrestricted-use stock • quality inspection stock Stock

only be posted from unrestricted stock, however. • You can take a

              <description>
			This business process is used to host and manage online reverse
auctions in a real-time environment. Purchasing professionals can
automatically generate an auction, populate the interface with all
information needed to start the bidding process, and notify all
qualified suppliers selected to participate in the event. They can
also create auctions directly from bid invitations. Purchasers can generate auctions automatically, via the sourcing
application, for example. The purchaser must then add any missing
information that is required to start the bidding process and
notify all qualified suppliers selected to participate in the
event. They can also create auctions directly from bid invitations,
which also enables them to include existing bids in the
auction. The creation process includes several options for populating
auctions with data, for example the purchaser can copy an existing
auction or use a template to create a new auction. The purchaser
can download an auction for offline editing and later upload the
changed file. Purchasers can set auction parameters to best meet their
business needs. For example, they can, where appropriate, stipulate
the level of bid decrement for each new bid submitted; in addition,
they can decide whether proxies are permitted, whether items should
end on a cascading basis, and whether certain items are grouped
together as a lot. Reverse auctions can drive bottom-line results significantly by
putting suppliers into direct competition, which ultimately
benefits the buyer. Purchasers can reject or accept bids, then
create a purchase order or contract using a one-step approval
workflow. All bid information resulting from an auction is copied
to the SRM backend, allowing for optional follow-on activities.</description>

              <description>
			You can use this business process to invite suppliers to submit bids in response to a bid invitation.Since negotiation is a critical step in the sourcing process, purchasing companies can use bid invitations to invite qualified suppliers to offer materials or services according to requirements. Typically, the supplier’s offer is final and binding and there is no opportunity for lowering bids. This makes bid invitations slightly less competitive than reverse auctions.This business process supports and streamlines bid invitation processes, enabling users to create bid invitations out of existing contracts and requisitions. It also provides the tools needed to quickly convert received bids into purchase orders or contracts. This accelerates the bid invitation process and vastly increases the productivity of purchasing professionals.</description>

              <description>In consignment processing, the vendor provides materials and stores
them on your premises. The vendor remains the legal owner of the
material until you withdraw materials from the consignment stores.
Only then does the vendor require payment. The invoice is due at
set periods of time, for example, monthly. In addition, you can
also arrange with the vendor that you take over ownership of the
remaining consignment material after a certain period of time. The
consignment stock is managed under the same number as your own
stock. Consignment stock can, therefore, be transferred to the
available stock. You can define consignment prices in foreign
currency. The currency in which the order is placed with the vendor
applies for consignment withdrawals. • You can determine
period-specific consignment prices. • You can specify the
consignment price in any unit of measure. • You can make use of
other condition functions used in Purchasing, such as discounts and
price quantity scales. • Consignment stocks of the same material
from different vendors can be managed independently from one
another and at the price of the individual vendors. • Consignment
stocks are not valuated. When the material is withdrawn it is
valuated at the price of the respective vendor. • A consignment
material can be allocated to one of three stock types: o
Unrestricted-use stock o Quality inspection stock o Blocked stock
You can make transfer postings between these three stock types.
Withdrawals can only be posted from unrestricted stock, however.</description>

              <description>In subcontracting, the vendor (the subcontractor) receives
components from which it produces a product. The product is then
ordered by your company through a purchase order. The components
required by the vendor to manufacture the ordered product are
listed in the purchase order and provided to the subcontractor. The
components can be determined by the system via a bill of material.
The components can be provided from a third-party-supplier instead
of from our own plant. The quantities of the components to be
provided to the vendor are entered into the stock of material to be
provided to vendor. This stock has the following features: • It is
managed as part of your total valuated stock, and is available for
MRP. • It is only managed at plant level, since it is not stored at
your own company but on the vendor's site. • Two stock types are
possible: • unrestricted-use stock • quality inspection stock Stock
can be transferred between the two stock types. Withdrawals can
only be posted from unrestricted stock, however. • You can take a
physical inventory of the stock of material to be provided to
vendor</description>

			You can use this business process to confirm the receipt of
goods. In Enterprise Buyer, requesters can create confirmations
themselves, even if the purchase order is in the backend system. It
is possible to create express confirmations directly in the Check
Status application without having to switch to another application.
Alternatively, an internal dispatcher or shipping department can
take delivery of goods and confirm centrally. In this case, an
additional approval workflow through the requisitioner is possible.
Then, the goods receipt is posted in the backend system. You can
also cancel an existing confirmation at item level. In addition to
all of this, you can return partial quantities of individual items
(or of all items) to your suppliers, and state the reasons for
these return deliveries. These reasons are also transferred to the
backend system.</description>

			The services actually performed (work actually done) by a service provider are recorded in a service entry sheet. You can enter both planned and unplanned services performed. As alternative, CATS can be used for time recording by internal or external staff. After the services have been recorded, one or more responsible persons must check that the work is satisfactory and formally accept the service entry sheet. This acceptance constitutes the basis for invoice verification and triggers the update of accounting information.</description>

			This business process allows you to perform central steps of the procurement process in SAP Supplier-Self Services (SAP SUS) using sales orders.Sales orders are created automatically in SAP SUS when purchase orders are created in the procurement system and sent to SAP SUS. Your procurement system can be either SAP Enterprise Buyer, SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), or a non-SAP procurement system, depending on which business scenario you have implemented.With SAP Enterprise Buyer you can receive purchase order responses (POR) via XML. This can be a notification that the vendor accepts all purchase order items and can deliver them as ordered; or the vendor notifies of variances from the purchase order because he can only partly confirm it.</description>

			As a purchaser, you can use this business process to decide, in the case of a potential supplier who has registered for specific product categories and returned the corresponding questionnaires, if the supplier is to be considered for a business relationship. If you decide in favor of the supplier, you accept the registration and transfer the supplier into the SRM Server System.You can also decide if the supplier is to become part of the SAP SUS System. Then the supplier could, for example, independently change his own data, or create follow-on documents and send them to the SRM Server System.To enable the above, the supplier must be assigned a special role in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This role ensures that an e-mail containing log-on details for the SAP-SUS System is sent to the supplier.Having logged on to the SAP-SUS System, the supplier can change his own data and the changed data is automatically forwarded to the supplier directory and to SAP Enterprise Buyer.</description>

			You can use this business process to make it easier for purchasing professionals to identify and select qualified suppliers by providing questionnaires that can be sent to potential vendors, that have registered themselves by using a link on the homepage of the purchasing company and have assigned themselves to specific product categories, to gather relevant information.The questionnaires can be customized to include information such as compliance to required standards, support for relevant business practices, or logistical capabilities for the on-time delivery of quality products or services. Typically used on first contact, these questionnaires can also be an invaluable source of information throughout the course of the relationship. Answers can be evaluated, stored, and used throughout the entire sourcing cycle to support additional supplier selection needs as they arise.</description>

Verification in the background You receive an invoice, only enter
the total amount of the invoice and match the invoice up with
another system document. The system then checks the invoice in the
background. If no errors occur, the system also posts the invoice
in the background. If errors do occur, the system saves the invoice
and you then have to process it in a separate step. You can post
invoices with reference to purchase orders or to goods receipts.
You can post invoices without reference to a purchase order, too. •
Invoices received via EDI or XML You can process invoices also via
EDI or XML, i.e. the invoice information enters the SAP R/3 System
via electronic data interchange and the system tries to post the
invoice automatically.</description>

			You can use this business process to invoice your customers for
specific services that were performed by external staff.  If you want to use these functions, you need to create a
purchase order in SRM which references an existing sales order in
the backend system. If external staff have access to a supplier system such as SAP
Supplier Self-Services, they can enter their services themselves
and send this data to the purchaser as a SAP XML message.
Alternatively, they can send service entry sheets to purchasers by
e-mail, fax, or regular mail. Purchasing assistants then enter the
data on the service entry sheets in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This data
forms the basis for the rest of the billing process in the backend
system.</description>

			You can use this business process to invoice your customers for
specific services that were performed by external staff.  If you want to use these functions, you need to create a
purchase order in SRM which references an existing sales order in
the backend system. If external staff have access to a supplier system such as SAP
Supplier Self-Services, they can enter their services themselves
and send this data to the purchaser as a SAP XML message.
Alternatively, they can send service entry sheets to purchasers by
e-mail, fax, or regular mail. Purchasing assistants then enter the
data on the service entry sheets in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This data
forms the basis for the rest of the billing process in the backend
system.</description>

			You can use this business process to invoice your customers for
specific services that were performed by external staff.  If you want to use these functions, you need to create a
purchase order in SRM which references an existing sales order in
the backend system. If external staff have access to a supplier system such as SAP
Supplier Self-Services, they can enter their services themselves
and send this data to the purchaser as a SAP XML message.
Alternatively, they can send service entry sheets to purchasers by
e-mail, fax, or regular mail. Purchasing assistants then enter the
data on the service entry sheets in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This data
forms the basis for the rest of the billing process in the backend
system.</description>

              <description>In Logistics Invoice Verification, incoming invoices are verified
in terms of their content, prices and arithmetic. When the invoice
is posted, the invoice data is saved in the system. The system
updates the data saved in the invoice documents in Materials
Management and Financial Accounting. An invoice can be processed in
Logistics Invoice Verification in online modus: • Invoice
verification online You receive an invoice and enter the
information contained in it in the system, comparing the data (such
as quantities and values) suggested by the system with that in the
invoice and making any necessary corrections. You then post the
invoice. • Document parking You receive an invoice, enter the data
in the system, and save the invoice document. The system does not
make any postings. You can change this parked document. When you
have finished changing the document, you can post the parked
document. You can post invoices with reference to purchase orders
or to goods receipts. You can post invoices without reference to a
purchase order, too. • Invoices received via EDI or XML You can
process invoices also via EDI or XML, i.e. the invoice information
enters the SAP R/3 System via electronic data interchange and the
system tries to post the invoice automatically.</description>

			You can use this business process to invoice your customers for
specific services that were performed by external staff.  If you want to use these functions, you need to create a
purchase order in SRM which references an existing sales order in
the backend system. If external staff have access to a supplier system such as SAP
Supplier Self-Services, they can enter their services themselves
and send this data to the purchaser as a SAP XML message.
Alternatively, they can send service entry sheets to purchasers by
e-mail, fax, or regular mail. Purchasing assistants then enter the
data on the service entry sheets in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This data
forms the basis for the rest of the billing process in the backend
system.</description>

Verification in the background You receive an invoice, only enter
the total amount of the invoice and match the invoice up with
another system document. The system then checks the invoice in the
background. If no errors occur, the system also posts the invoice
in the background. If errors do occur, the system saves the invoice
and you then have to process it in a separate step. You can post
invoices with reference to purchase orders or to goods receipts.
You can post invoices without reference to a purchase order, too. •
Invoices received via EDI or XML You can process invoices also via
EDI or XML, i.e. the invoice information enters the SAP R/3 System
via electronic data interchange and the system tries to post the
invoice automatically.</description>

              <description>In consignment processing, the vendor provides materials and stores
them on your premises. The vendor remains the legal owner of the
material until you withdraw materials from the consignment stores.
Only then does the vendor require payment. The invoice is due at
set periods of time, for example, monthly. In addition, you can
also arrange with the vendor that you take over ownership of the
remaining consignment material after a certain period of time. The
consignment stock is managed under the same number as your own
stock. Consignment stock can, therefore, be transferred to the
available stock. You can define consignment prices in foreign
currency. The currency in which the order is placed with the vendor
applies for consignment withdrawals. • You can determine
period-specific consignment prices. • You can specify the
consignment price in any unit of measure. • You can make use of
other condition functions used in Purchasing, such as discounts and
price quantity scales. • Consignment stocks of the same material
from different vendors can be managed independently from one
another and at the price of the individual vendors. • Consignment
stocks are not valuated. When the material is withdrawn it is
valuated at the price of the respective vendor. • A consignment
material can be allocated to one of three stock types: o
Unrestricted-use stock o Quality inspection stock o Blocked stock
You can make transfer postings between these three stock types.
Withdrawals can only be posted from unrestricted stock, however.</description>

components from which it produces a product. The product is then
ordered by your company through a purchase order. The components
required by the vendor to manufacture the ordered product are
listed in the purchase order and provided to the subcontractor. The
components can be determined by the system via a bill of material.
The components can be provided from a third-party-supplier instead
of from our own plant. The quantities of the components to be
provided to the vendor are entered into the stock of material to be
provided to vendor. This stock has the following features: • It is
managed as part of your total valuated stock, and is available for
MRP. • It is only managed at plant level, since it is not stored at
your own company but on the vendor's site. • Two stock types are
possible: • unrestricted-use stock • quality inspection stock Stock
can be transferred between the two stock types. Withdrawals can
only be posted from unrestricted stock, however. • You can take a
physical inventory of the stock of material to be provided to
vendor</description>

			As a purchaser, you can use this business process to decide, in the case of a potential supplier who has registered for specific product categories and returned the corresponding questionnaires, if the supplier is to be considered for a business relationship. If you decide in favor of the supplier, you accept the registration and transfer the supplier into the SRM Server System.You can also decide if the supplier is to become part of the SAP SUS System. Then the supplier could, for example, independently change his own data, or create follow-on documents and send them to the SRM Server System.To enable the above, the supplier must be assigned a special role in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This role ensures that an e-mail containing log-on details for the SAP-SUS System is sent to the supplier.Having logged on to the SAP-SUS System, the supplier can change his own data and the changed data is automatically forwarded to the supplier directory and to SAP Enterprise Buyer.</description>

			This business process allows you to perform central steps of the procurement process in SAP Supplier-Self Services (SAP SUS) using sales orders.Sales orders are created automatically in SAP SUS when purchase orders are created in the procurement system and sent to SAP SUS. Your procurement system can be either SAP Enterprise Buyer, SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), or a non-SAP procurement system, depending on which business scenario you have implemented.With SAP Enterprise Buyer you can receive purchase order responses (POR) via XML. This can be a notification that the vendor accepts all purchase order items and can deliver them as ordered; or the vendor notifies of variances from the purchase order because he can only partly confirm it.</description>

			This business process allows you to perform central steps of the procurement process in SAP Supplier-Self Services (SAP SUS) using sales orders.Sales orders are created automatically in SAP SUS when purchase orders are created in the procurement system and sent to SAP SUS. Your procurement system can be either SAP Enterprise Buyer, SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), or a non-SAP procurement system, depending on which business scenario you have implemented.With SAP Enterprise Buyer you can receive purchase order responses (POR) via XML. This can be a notification that the vendor accepts all purchase order items and can deliver them as ordered; or the vendor notifies of variances from the purchase order because he can only partly confirm it.</description>

			As a purchaser, you can use this business process to decide, in the case of a potential supplier who has registered for specific product categories and returned the corresponding questionnaires, if the supplier is to be considered for a business relationship. If you decide in favor of the supplier, you accept the registration and transfer the supplier into the SRM Server System.You can also decide if the supplier is to become part of the SAP SUS System. Then the supplier could, for example, independently change his own data, or create follow-on documents and send them to the SRM Server System.To enable the above, the supplier must be assigned a special role in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This role ensures that an e-mail containing log-on details for the SAP-SUS System is sent to the supplier.Having logged on to the SAP-SUS System, the supplier can change his own data and the changed data is automatically forwarded to the supplier directory and to SAP Enterprise Buyer.</description>

			You can use this business process to invoice your customers for
specific services that were performed by external staff.  If you want to use these functions, you need to create a
purchase order in SRM which references an existing sales order in
the backend system. If external staff have access to a supplier system such as SAP
Supplier Self-Services, they can enter their services themselves
and send this data to the purchaser as a SAP XML message.
Alternatively, they can send service entry sheets to purchasers by
e-mail, fax, or regular mail. Purchasing assistants then enter the
data on the service entry sheets in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This data
forms the basis for the rest of the billing process in the backend
system.</description>

			You can use this business process to invoice your customers for
specific services that were performed by external staff.  If you want to use these functions, you need to create a
purchase order in SRM which references an existing sales order in
the backend system. If external staff have access to a supplier system such as SAP
Supplier Self-Services, they can enter their services themselves
and send this data to the purchaser as a SAP XML message.
Alternatively, they can send service entry sheets to purchasers by
e-mail, fax, or regular mail. Purchasing assistants then enter the
data on the service entry sheets in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This data
forms the basis for the rest of the billing process in the backend
system.</description>

and you then have to process it in a separate step. You can post
invoices with reference to purchase orders or to goods receipts.
You can post invoices without reference to a purchase order, too. •
Invoices received via EDI or XML You can process invoices also via
EDI or XML, i.e. the invoice information enters the SAP R/3 System
via electronic data interchange and the system tries to post the
invoice automatically.</description>

              <description>In Logistics Invoice Verification, incoming invoices are verified
in terms of their content, prices and arithmetic. When the invoice
is posted, the invoice data is saved in the system. The system
updates the data saved in the invoice documents in Materials
Management and Financial Accounting. An invoice can be processed in
Logistics Invoice Verification in online modus: • Invoice
verification online You receive an invoice and enter the
information contained in it in the system, comparing the data (such
as quantities and values) suggested by the system with that in the
invoice and making any necessary corrections. You then post the
invoice. • Document parking You receive an invoice, enter the data
in the system, and save the invoice document. The system does not
make any postings. You can change this parked document. When you
have finished changing the document, you can post the parked
document. You can post invoices with reference to purchase orders
or to goods receipts. You can post invoices without reference to a
purchase order, too. • Invoices received via EDI or XML You can
process invoices also via EDI or XML, i.e. the invoice information

			You can use this business process to confirm the receipt of
goods. In Enterprise Buyer, requesters can create confirmations
themselves, even if the purchase order is in the backend system. It
is possible to create express confirmations directly in the Check
Status application without having to switch to another application.
Alternatively, an internal dispatcher or shipping department can
take delivery of goods and confirm centrally. In this case, an
additional approval workflow through the requisitioner is possible.
Then, the goods receipt is posted in the backend system. You can
also cancel an existing confirmation at item level. In addition to
all of this, you can return partial quantities of individual items
(or of all items) to your suppliers, and state the reasons for
these return deliveries. These reasons are also transferred to the
backend system.</description>

			You can use this business process to confirm the receipt of
goods. In Enterprise Buyer, requesters can create confirmations
themselves, even if the purchase order is in the backend system. It
is possible to create express confirmations directly in the Check
Status application without having to switch to another application.
Alternatively, an internal dispatcher or shipping department can
take delivery of goods and confirm centrally. In this case, an
additional approval workflow through the requisitioner is possible.
Then, the goods receipt is posted in the backend system. You can
also cancel an existing confirmation at item level. In addition to
all of this, you can return partial quantities of individual items
(or of all items) to your suppliers, and state the reasons for
these return deliveries. These reasons are also transferred to the
backend system.</description>

			You can use this business process to confirm the receipt of
goods. In Enterprise Buyer, requesters can create confirmations
themselves, even if the purchase order is in the backend system. It
is possible to create express confirmations directly in the Check
Status application without having to switch to another application.
Alternatively, an internal dispatcher or shipping department can
take delivery of goods and confirm centrally. In this case, an
additional approval workflow through the requisitioner is possible.
Then, the goods receipt is posted in the backend system. You can
also cancel an existing confirmation at item level. In addition to
all of this, you can return partial quantities of individual items
(or of all items) to your suppliers, and state the reasons for
these return deliveries. These reasons are also transferred to the
backend system.</description>

			As a purchaser, you can use this business process to decide, in the case of a potential supplier who has registered for specific product categories and returned the corresponding questionnaires, if the supplier is to be considered for a business relationship. If you decide in favor of the supplier, you accept the registration and transfer the supplier into the SRM Server System.You can also decide if the supplier is to become part of the SAP SUS System. Then the supplier could, for example, independently change his own data, or create follow-on documents and send them to the SRM Server System.To enable the above, the supplier must be assigned a special role in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This role ensures that an e-mail containing log-on details for the SAP-SUS System is sent to the supplier.Having logged on to the SAP-SUS System, the supplier can change his own data and the changed data is automatically forwarded to the supplier directory and to SAP Enterprise Buyer.</description>

			This business process allows you to perform central steps of the procurement process in SAP Supplier-Self Services (SAP SUS) using sales orders.Sales orders are created automatically in SAP SUS when purchase orders are created in the procurement system and sent to SAP SUS. Your procurement system can be either SAP Enterprise Buyer, SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), or a non-SAP procurement system, depending on which business scenario you have implemented.With SAP Enterprise Buyer you can receive purchase order responses (POR) via XML. This can be a notification that the vendor accepts all purchase order items and can deliver them as ordered; or the vendor notifies of variances from the purchase order because he can only partly confirm it.</description>

			You can use this business process to make it easier for purchasing professionals to identify and select qualified suppliers by providing questionnaires that can be sent to potential vendors, that have registered themselves by using a link on the homepage of the purchasing company and have assigned themselves to specific product categories, to gather relevant information.The questionnaires can be customized to include information such as compliance to required standards, support for relevant business practices, or logistical capabilities for the on-time delivery of quality products or services. Typically used on first contact, these questionnaires can also be an invaluable source of information throughout the course of the relationship. Answers can be evaluated, stored, and used throughout the entire sourcing cycle to support additional supplier selection needs as they arise.</description>

          <description>
			In consignment processing, the vendor provides materials and
stores them on your premises. The vendor remains the legal owner of
the material until you withdraw materials from the consignment
stores. Only then does the vendor require payment. The invoice is
due at set periods of time, for example, monthly. In addition, you
can also arrange with the vendor that you take over ownership of
the remaining consignment material after a certain period of time.
The consignment stock is managed under the same number as your own
stock. Consignment stock can, therefore, be transferred to the
available stock.Consignment stocks of the same material from different vendors
can be managed independently from one another and at the price of
the individual vendors.Consignment stocks are not valuated. When the material is
withdrawn it is valuated at the price of the respective vendor.A consignment material can be allocated to one of three stock
types:You can make transfer postings between these three stock types.
Withdrawals can only be posted from unrestricted stock,
however.</description>

				Product Development
covers the entire life-cycle of product related Master Data such as
product structures, routings and documents from invention to
phase-out providing functions to manage and deliver the wide range
of product information and ensure immediate access to up-to-date
data. The solution facilitates effective collaboration both within
and beyond the organization and streamlines processes from the
early development phase through to production. Detailed analysis of the
planning and implementation data in a company, who are involved in
the development and implementation of new products, means that
alternative planned and actual figures for product development can
be compared and the results used to make fundamental decisions and
develop product strategies.

			This business process allows you to perform central steps of the procurement process in SAP Supplier-Self Services (SAP SUS) using sales orders.Sales orders are created automatically in SAP SUS when purchase orders are created in the procurement system and sent to SAP SUS. Your procurement system can be either SAP Enterprise Buyer, SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), or a non-SAP procurement system, depending on which business scenario you have implemented.With SAP Enterprise Buyer you can receive purchase order responses (POR) via XML. This can be a notification that the vendor accepts all purchase order items and can deliver them as ordered; or the vendor notifies of variances from the purchase order because he can only partly confirm it.</description>

			As a purchaser, you can use this business process to decide, in the case of a potential supplier who has registered for specific product categories and returned the corresponding questionnaires, if the supplier is to be considered for a business relationship. If you decide in favor of the supplier, you accept the registration and transfer the supplier into the SRM Server System.You can also decide if the supplier is to become part of the SAP SUS System. Then the supplier could, for example, independently change his own data, or create follow-on documents and send them to the SRM Server System.To enable the above, the supplier must be assigned a special role in SAP Enterprise Buyer. This role ensures that an e-mail containing log-on details for the SAP-SUS System is sent to the supplier.Having logged on to the SAP-SUS System, the supplier can change his own data and the changed data is automatically forwarded to the supplier directory and to SAP Enterprise Buyer.</description>

			You can use this business process to make it easier for purchasing professionals to identify and select qualified suppliers by providing questionnaires that can be sent to potential vendors, that have registered themselves by using a link on the homepage of the purchasing company and have assigned themselves to specific product categories, to gather relevant information.The questionnaires can be customized to include information such as compliance to required standards, support for relevant business practices, or logistical capabilities for the on-time delivery of quality products or services. Typically used on first contact, these questionnaires can also be an invaluable source of information throughout the course of the relationship. Answers can be evaluated, stored, and used throughout the entire sourcing cycle to support additional supplier selection needs as they arise.</description>

			You use this process to design your commission plans with all
the related master data in ICM. This is the second part of your
implementation project. However, you must also carry out any
amendments or additions after the implementation, for example if
you change your incentive strategy and plans or if you add new
commission recipients. To do this, you first define all the recipients of direct and
indirect commission, who may be internal employees as well as
external partners, as business partners in the role of CACSA1. You
then assign the business partners in your sender system to those in
ICM. You also define all the different kinds of agreements that
exist between your company and your commission recipients. These
are subsequently converted into commission contracts. You may use
standard commission contracts as templates and individualize them
accordingly. You finally assign the commission recipients and their
contracts to your company’s organizational structure to allow the
recipients to participate in the commission.

			You use this process to manage your transactional data and carry out your commission calculations. The process steps are executed automatically by the ICM system.
			The sender system
transfers the commission cases to ICM. Commission cases are the
activities of a commission recipient for which commissions are to
be calculated. ICM then automatically determines all the other
commission recipients who participated in this commission case. ICM
also determines the current valuation of the business object,
calculates the remuneration amounts for the commission recipients
based on their contracts, and posts the results to their ICM
accounts. Only if a commission
case is interrupted by certain system-defined or customer-defined
checking routines and is set to the status “pending, for example
due to missing data or because the defined threshold values have
been exceed, it has to be adjusted manually by the commission clerk
or the respective manager before processing can be continued. At the end of the
period, closing is carried out. All the commission case results are
summarized and bonuses are calculated. Any flat rates are added,
liabilities or cancellation reserves are deducted, guarantee
payments checked and taken into consideration where appropriate.
The results are then transferred to the settlement application for
payment. After closing and
settlement, a correspondence document containing the relevant
commission data for the recipients is automatically created.
Depending on the reporting system used, the commission results may
also be updated there.</description>

					Provide precise customer
location and installed-equipment information to call center, field
service, depot repair, and sales staff.  Phase-in and phase-out:
You can maintain master data required to perform effective
maintenance on a piece of equipment. This includes the Equipment
Master Record, Maintenance Plan, Measuring Point, Task List, Bill
of Materials (BOMs). Transfer assets from their current assignment,
either to be reused by another department or company, or to be
disposed of completely. Asset Scrapping: Once an
equipment has been phased out of service it can be scrapped. This
includes removing it from the financial asset register, complying
with regulations regarding the environment, salvaging any re-usable
parts, removing from site. </description>

			Warranty Claim Processing fulfills the needs both of manufacturers, importers or vendors of complex products and their suppliers. In this business environment, the prerequisites for a right to warranty are becoming more extensive and more complex. Warranty restrictions due to the length of service or age of the product, authorization processes and comprehensivecheck mechanisms in the warranty claim make warranty claim processing in many companies a timely and costly procedure. Furthermore, due to a European legal initiative, the warranty or guarantee period for products of specific industry sectors has been extended to at least two years. The number of incoming warranty claims has, understandably, increased in the wake of this decision. Warranty Claim Processing offers you a software solution that can deal with a large number of warranty claims comfortably and, as far as possible, automatically. Only those claims that produce negative results in the automatic checks are included in manual processing. You also have a maximum amount of flexibility as regards the warranty conditions that you can define.</description>

			You can use amount allocation to allocate items to multiple external and internal recipients. These items may be either billable or non-billable because of warranty claims, and they may stem from service orders or service confirmations. You can assign internal and external recipients when you create the service order or service confirmation.When you create an amount allocation document, the bill-to party and invoice value are copied from the service order or service confirmation. You can still process or edit this data in amount allocation.</description>

process enables you to create and maintain service plans. A service
plan is a functional enhancement of the service contract, whereby
the service plan is represented as an individual item category of
the service contract item. The maintenance of service plans takes
place at item level of a service contract.</description>

			During the processing of a service order, it is possible that the time targets agreed in the Service Level Agreements cannot be met, for example, if the completion date of the order is exceeded and the transaction is still in process. In this case, predefined company-specific follow-up activities are automatically triggered as escalation measures to preempt customers from making complaints. An escalation measure could be, for example, notifying customers promptly about delayed service employees, or informing them about a delay in the availability of spare parts.</description>

				Provides a comprehensive
set of capabilities designed for selling, planning, delivering and
billing project-based services. Projects have to be created,
structured, and staffed with the appropriate resources, complex
services are delivered and the associated projects have to be
executed within a given timeframe, with a satisfying quality and
according to contractual agreements. Changes in project timelines,
scope, and staffing have to be handled. An integrated project
controlling is the bracket for many other scenarios. Engagement
Management processes accompany service delivery: contracts have to
be set up according to customer agreements, times and expenses are
recorded and are priced and billed to the customer in various
ways.

				This business process
enables you to create, issue, and monitor sales orders for
customized products or services that are assembled on receipt of
order. In an assemble-to-order environment, key components are
planned or stocked in anticipation of the sales order.
Assemble-to-order production is useful if a large number of
finished products can be assembled from common
components.</description>

			You can use this business process to calculate and distribute
apportionable costs for the use and maintenance of real estate to
the tenants occupying the space, for a particular settlement
period, according to a number of different parameters. A tenant leases space for a commercial purpose or an apartment
for residential use. A number of services are provided for the
maintenance and service of the real estate objects. These include
janitorial services, gardening, cleaning, maintenance and repair.
You negotiate the contractual agreements for these services with
the individual service providers, and create lease agreements with
your tenants.
     The service charge settlement, or charge-back, process ensures
that operating costs for services are accurately determined and
billed.

        During plant operation,
a complete and reliable plant maintenance solution leads to higher
system availability and reduced breakdown costs by means of
preventive inspections and maintenance. Enterprise Asset Management
allows for more transparent and simplified processes through
integrated plant maintenance capabilities. Therefore, material and
labor costs can be reduced while maintaining the same level of
system quality, and costs for the use of external service providers
can be optimized.

				Project and portfolio
management enables portfolio managers to better identify, select,
prioritize, and manage a portfolio of projects. Portfolio
management includes key performance metrics on budgets, schedules,
and staffing. This centralized view of performing and at-risk
elements is critical for managing enterprise-wide project
portfolios. Project and portfolio
management enables the project manager to work closely together
with team members and management on any kind of project, such as
enterprise IT projects, service projects (please refer to
professional service delivery) or research and development
projects. After management has triggered  new product development,
the project manager can set up the project structure and network
based on templates. The comprehensive project management solution
enables him to manage schedules, resources, assigned documents and
materials, costs, and budgets. Team members are notified via
workflow when they need to fulfill their project-related tasks
according to the overall network. They report on progress, and the
actual dates and costs are immediately updated so that management
can monitor the project at any time. The result is efficient
project management which provides significant value potential -
each day gained saves money and brings products to the market
faster.

					An audit is a systematic examination used to determine to what
extend an object meets previously specified criteria. Audits are
usually performed using question lists which represent the
criteria. Audit management means to plan and process audits, grade
the audit objects, monitor corrective and preventive actions that
were based on the findings, and analyse audit data. You can trigger
a quality notification out of an audit finding for further
processing. Evaluation of audit results can be executed using mySAP
Business Intelligence.The Audit Management component is very versatile can support
various audit types that are performed on the basis of previously
specified criteria. Examples of usages are:</description>

					The process of assigning
official material numbers for the export or import of goods is
called product classification. It is a time-consuming task that
involves intimate knowledge of multiple classification taxonomies
and is open to a range of interpretations. The product
classification capabilities of SAP Customs Management simplify this
important task by enabling companies to upload classification data
from authorized providers. To classify a product, users can search
for the right number via drill-down or employ powerful phonetic
search capabilities that scour the schema and make intelligent
classification proposals.</description>

Authorities. The Duty Calculation capabilities of SAP Customs
Management enable the calculation of the import duty to be paid and
store this information in customs documents. Tax rate data for
different customs authorities can be uploaded from data providers
or maintained manually. With abilities to account for value-adds,
rebates, transportation costs, insurance, royalties, and other
mitigating considerations, the calculator accurately determines
duty rates based on the ultimate transaction value of the imported
commodities.</description>

					The Customs
Communication Service enables the electronic communication with
customs authorities for transit and customs procedures. The customs
communication process is defined via a process profile. In this
profile, the necessary activities for communicating with the
customs authorities are defined. The corresponding inbound or
outbound EDI messages can be assigned to each activity. Using these
profiles, SAP GTS can handle various international customs
communication processes, such as the New Computerized Transit
System (NCTS) in the European Union, the Automated Export System
(AES) in the United States, the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) in
Australia, and others.</description>

SAP GTS help companies to take advantage of reduced rates on
customs duties or exemption based on established rules. SAP GTS
automates the entire process including requesting vendor
declarations from suppliers, calculating and publishing eligibility
information in sales documents, and providing detailed reports. SAP
GTS thereby helps companies comply with regional trade agreements,
eliminate risks through documentation and audit trails, and ensure
competitiveness through reduced duty rates.</description>
