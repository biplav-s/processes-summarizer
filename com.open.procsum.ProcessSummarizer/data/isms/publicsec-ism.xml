				The requirements that have been created and released for procurement (for example, demands for spare parts coming from plant maintenance, demands for raw materials determined in a planning run, or requests for office supplies entered by an employee) are transferred to purchasing as purchasing requisitions. They are presented to the purchasing agent in worklists that support him or her in converting the requisitions into purchase orders. The purchasing agent can check the source of supply and the price and conditions that have been assigned to a requisition and start a request for quotation or bidding process if necessary.

       The scenario starts with material requirements, planning, or sales
orders to create purchase requisitions. This MRP can take place in
any legal system. The requisitions are loaded in the procurements
system via interface. The purchase requisitions are sourced against
valid sources of supply. Call-offs to existing long-term contracts
are processed automatically. If no sources of supply are available
in the system, the solicitation process is started. RFx
responses from the offerors are evaluated and lead to purchase
orders. Goods receipt and invoice receipt are entered into the
system.

			Public Sector
organizations receive and handle money that they receive from

so in exchange for close control of all financial processes. Public
Sector Accounting therefore is one of the most important tasks of

prevention, intervention and treatment services provided to
individuals and families who need assistance in maintaining or
achieving their full potential for self-sufficiency and healthy
independent living. These services promote and protect the
physical, mental, spiritual, social and economic well-being of
individuals and families.  Social Security is a system
that acts as a safety net for all citizens in a country. It is a
program that uses public funds to provide a degree of economic
security for the public. It is paid by every employee and therefore
supports everyone who meets certain entitlement criteria.</description>

				The strategies,
management, and actions that ensure the Social Service Agency has
the ability to  identify, contact, and communicate with prospective
clients and potential providers in order to provide awareness of
the internal and external services and social programs it has to
offer. This can be done locally, regionally,countywide, statewide,
or at the federal level.</description>

        <description>
					A Social Services
campaign is often divided into two categories; one is to acquire
resources for existing programs, while the other is to raise
general awareness of existing programs and services.An example of the first
one is the recruitment of prospective foster parents or day care
providers. An example for the second would be the building of
public awareness around the services of the child support
enforcement program. This would draw citizens attention to an area
of entitlement that they might not realize they are automatically
eligible for.  In order to conduct an
external campaign, there are several ways and means to do this,
this could involve various types of media including, but not
limited to: newspaper advertising, a blurb on the Agency website,
billboards, and radio advertising. The
administrative challenge requires a clear definition of the
campaign’s objectives and progress indicators, in order for the
effectiveness of the campaign to be evaluated.     </description>

Programs for a given client (or a household).In addition, there may
be cases created for other purposes: example: Appeal Case for
issues on the core  case, a foster care case, or a child support
enforcement court case case.The repository is a
master database containing  the case-specific information for all 
the  types and subsets of cases for all of the programs supported
by the social services system. The capability to interrelate cases
is necessary (e.g. Appeal Case to Benefits Case being
appealed).</description>

        <description>
					This process defines the
steps for Social Services agencies to issue payments to external
parties. Two major scenarios can be named here: the delivery
of direct financial aid to clients, who have been deemed eligible
for benefit payments and the payment for services delivered by
third party service providers to the client. Program-related benefit
payments are calculated and generated in context of client cases. A
case may involve multiple outgoing payment instructions to several
involved parties. Payment Instructions bear financial details
regarding amount, schedule, method (i.e. bank transfer or check),
currency, tax, surcharges and many more. The actual
financial transactions are managed and executed via individual
client accounts, featuring structured payment history between the
organization and the concerned parties. Key process steps include
controlled deduction of regular benefit payments to cover open
liabilties as well as payments to third parties. Payment to service
providers are usually triggered, when the third-party services have
been delivered. The responsible service provider sends in an
according invoice, which is entered and verified against the
services ordered. If no major discrepancy is detected, the invoice
amount will be posted on the service provider’s financial account,
from where the payment to the provider is issued. Another form of
provider payment is the purchase of a contingent of services, e.g.
foster home capacity. In that case, payment execution could already
take place in advance to the actual service delivery.</description>

					While payment processing
deals with the management of outgoing payment to client, the
collection and liability management cover the management of
receivables from clients.  The process ensures that
open liabilities are properly posted to the client account and that
an invoice is sent to the client.  Upon incoming payment from
client, the received money will be allocated to the appropriate
liabilities.  Additional activities involve clearing of open
liabilties on the client account through deductions
or write-offs, in case a payment by the client cannot be
expected. An overpayment situation can occur when the circumstances
of living of a client changed, which have a negative impact on
his eligibility for benefit payment . In that case, the overpaid
money is considered as a liability and then subject to collection.

				Public sector
institutions as well as non-for-profit organizations receive
considerable funding from external sources. The SAP solutions
enable them to  meet individual sponsor requirements without
compromising their internal accounting processes. Grants, donations or
awards can be managed over their whole life-cycle – from internal
draft and application to the consumption and the final close-out.
The management of passthrough grants is included in all these
phases. The Expenditure
Certification allows for the – subsequent – assignment of projects
to external funding sources. In the funding agreement, the sponsor
outlines only the general purpose of funding. The recipient may
then decide before, during or after the execution of a project
whether it shall be financed by this or another sponsor. This
solution focuses mainly but not exclusively on the European
Structural Funds.</description>

business submitting the form as well as to the public organization
processing the request.To make the most of
these potential advantages, electronic forms should be designed as
interactive forms providing features such as automatic prefill of
available information into the form or automatic entry checking,
including format checks and consistency checks across the entered
or known information. Obviously, online forms, which are completed
in an online session on the forms server, can provide deeper
interactive features than offline forms, which can be completed
without online connection.SAP's e-government
solution provides both online and offline forms.</description>

          <description>
						Although the importance
of electronic forms is increasing, the traditional paper-based
forms cannot be completely replaced. As part of the multi-channel
concept, these paper-forms also have to be linked to an unified
processing flow within the administration, which is independent of
how the request was sent to the public organization. Therefore,
paper-forms are often scanned to allow effective processing in an
electronic way.SAP's e-government
solution automatically imports scanned forms for electronic
processing. It also receives the form content from other
applications used by the requester to complete the form.</description>

sometimes other persons also complete forms on behalf of the
requester. For example, lawyers or bank clerks may submit
application forms for their clients or an employee may complete a
request on behalf of his company. In these cases, it is important
to differentiate between the person submitting the request and the
real requesting party.</description>

					The enhanced revenue distribution functionality provides tax
agencies the ability to distribute taxes based on actual and
projected revenues collected. This becomes important as some State

projected revenues collected and other governments distribute only
cash-based revenues or accrued revenues (excluding projections).
Tax revenues may be distributed to the same internal organization
and fund as originally assigned during the tax liability creation,
but could also be distributed to different levels in the
organization and to external organizations and State Funds. The
agencies may also perform multiple levels of revenue distribution
and/or allocation depending on specific revenue types.</description>

        <description>
					This process is tuned to
handle high-volumes of outstanding tax liabilites and tax filing
obligations. Taxpayer accounts are evaluated based on the
collection strategy assigned to the taxpayer or to one or several
accounts of the taxpayer. Based on taxpayer attributes and
information about the outstanding debts the collection run
determines the most effective collection activity to be performed.
Collection activities can be automatic tasks such as dunning
letters, transfers to collection agencies and manual tasks of
collection agents. The rules used for determining collection
activities can be maintained in a flexible decision tree. All
taxpayer attributes and contextual information about the
taxpayer may be considered.Thus, collections
management becomes more effective - relieving employees of
unproductive routine activities and empowering them to take care of
critical accounts personally. Uncollected debts and overdue tax
filing obligations are reduced and voluntary compliance is
increased. </description>
