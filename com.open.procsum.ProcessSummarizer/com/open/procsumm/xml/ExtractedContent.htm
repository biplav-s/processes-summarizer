Based on a Change Control Request form, this process will provide us with the ability to maintain the master records for the GL accounts in the FI module of SAP.  As a result of this action, we can create, change, or delete a GL account. In addition, a **A test of rules** that is created in the Chart of Accounts will not be able to post in a Company until it is created or extended to the Company Code. Also, this will include the maintenance of cost element master data in CO, which is used in management reporting.

Corporate Reorganizations, Acquisitions, Statutory and Management requirements are events, which may trigger the creation of new **A test of rules**s. These new **A test of rules**s may be extended to Companies in the FI Module and Cost Elements in the Controlling Module (CO) of SAP.
